# Implementing-Iterative-Methods
This project implements three iterative solvers for linear systems of the form

<h1 align="center">𝐴𝑥 = 𝑏</h1>

where A is a symmetric positive definite matrix and b is an n-dimensional vector.
Each method is implemented as a function that takes inputs (A, b) and returns the approximate solution and its residual history.
# Method 1: Conjugate Gradient
Conjugate Gradient solves Ax=b by generating A-conjugate search directions, ensuring efficient progress and typically converging in far fewer than n iterations.

# Method 2: GMRES
GMRES (Generalized Minimal Residual) builds a Krylov subspace and computes the solution that minimizes the residual norm at each step using least-squares over that subspace.

# Method 3: BiCGSTAB
BiCGSTAB (Bi-Conjugate Gradient Stabilized) is designed for general nonsymmetric matrices and improves stability by combining bi-conjugacy ideas with an additional smoothing step.

# Run
run the following in order 
- function spd_matrix
- function conjugate_gradient
- function gmres_residuals
- function bicgstab_residuals
If you want to see the plots run the follwing after each function:
- using Plots
This will store the plots and display them.
If you want to see the evaluation run the follwing after each function
- Random.seed
Then run the last two code blocks
